# Object Orented Rust

Based on the definition of OOP, Rust is object oriented:

```
Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An object packages both data
and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are typically
called methods or operations.
```

Rust allows you to provide methods on data via impl blocks on structs and enums.
According to many modern definitions though Rust is not an OOP language because
it lacks classes and traditional inheretence.  These things generally are
**unnecessary** and one of Rust's strengths is that it didn't follow the herd.
In that sense it didn't absorb some of the bad parts of OOP (Yes, it's not
actually a silver bullet).
