# Learn-Rust

I'm currently working through the beautifully written book:
[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

This repository will document my learnings (and hopefully help you learn Rust
too!). I've put mini rust projects into directories for which Chapter in the
Rust book they relate to. Click through this directory to see my quick and dirty
summaries of each chapter.  Chapter 1 is just install so we start on Chapter 2.
