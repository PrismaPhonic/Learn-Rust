# Dining Philosophers

This is a project from the rust language book version 1.6.0 - not included in
the newest Rust Language Book.  I thought it would be a fun way to re-enforce
concepts around concurrency so I'll be including what I learned from working on
this project. If you'd like to make this project yourself you can read about it
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/book/dining-philosophers.html)
